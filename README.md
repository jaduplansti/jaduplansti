# Hi there, I'm jaduplansti 👋

I'm an aspiring segfault artist and a fan of causing undefined behavior (UB) for fun.

## 🛠️ What I Like
- Circuits & Electronics
- Math that makes your brain hurt
- Pushing the boundaries of compilers (and sometimes breaking them)
- Making buggy games
- Not-so-functional compilers and software

## 💡 What to Expect Here
Most of the projects in my repositories are unfinished—so don’t be surprised if you find experiments, prototypes, or things that only work on my machine.

## ⚡ Fun Fact
If undefined behavior had a fan club, I'd probably be president.
